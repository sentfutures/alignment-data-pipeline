"""Step 1: Generate scenarios, then draft dilemma prompts. Sub-stages:

- Step 1a — scenario deal + plan: deal a stratified variable combination per
  example from the weighted matrix in prompts/dad/variables.txt (offline;
  dad_pipeline/compose_scenarios.py owns the dealing and the structural
  rules), then one plan call per deal renders prompts/dad/step1a_scenario.txt
  and turns the combination into a self-contained scenario description
  (extracted fail-closed; INCOHERENT combinations are checkpointed as
  deliberate rejections in scenario_rejects.jsonl and never retried). Deals
  persist to step1/scenario_deals.jsonl and planned scenarios to
  step1/scenarios.jsonl, so --resume replays the same deal and only plans
  what's missing. Pre-plan runs (scenarios.jsonl without a deals file) skip
  planning; when drafted through the current single-scenario template, their
  rendered legacy card fills the scenario-description slot (see
  compose_scenarios.render_draft_prompt) — a run whose snapshot still holds
  the old batch template is refused loudly instead.

- Step 1b — first attempt: one draft call per scenario (SDF layer-3 style),
  fanned out via parallel_map. The prompt renders the plan's scenario
  description, the persona voice, and the dealt length register
  (prompts/dad/step1b_dilemmas.txt); the reply is the user message inside
  <user_prompt> tags, extracted fail-closed. The dealt length register is an
  instruction only — never measured or enforced. 1b writes no annotation —
  the dealt labels ARE the design, and the
  record's annotation is synthesized from the scenario. Accepted drafts are
  taken as returned; distribution fidelity is monitored by the corpus-level
  checklist instead.

- Step 1c — quality gate (optional; config dad.dilemmas.gate, on by default):
  a model call JUDGES each 1b draft against its scenario per
  prompts/dad/step1c_gate.txt — pass/fail, never a rewrite. The four checks:
  the welfare stake is load-bearing, the message is self-contained, the scene
  is cohesive, and the message reads like a real person wrote it (the
  card-adherence check was deliberately dropped — see 9f65553; distribution
  fidelity is the corpus checklist's job). A rejected scenario is
  routed back through the drafting loop with the gate's reasons injected into
  the next attempt (so it redrafts away from them), capped at
  MAX_GATE_REDRAFTS; a scenario still failing after the cap ships with
  gate_failures stamped on its record. Verdicts are logged to step1/gate.jsonl;
  unusable gate replies (retried once) persist to step1/gate_failures.jsonl
  and fail open (ship the draft — degraded gating costs a weak prompt, never
  a stalled run).

- Step 1d — prompt refine (optional; config dad.dilemmas.refine, on by
  default; runs on gate-passed drafts): one review-and-rewrite call per draft
  (single-scenario, SDF layer-4 style) per prompts/dad/step1d_refine.txt —
  editor notes in prose, the rewritten message in <revised_user_prompt> tags,
  extracted fail-closed, with the dealt surface form / visibility / attitude /
  opening / closing bound as cards. The 1b draft is kept on the record
  (draft_user_message + refine_notes) and the before/after is logged to
  step1/refinements.jsonl. A draft 1c judges unfixable by rewriting alone
  (<unfixable> verdict) is a deliberate rejection mirroring 1a's INCOHERENT:
  checkpointed to step1/refine_rejects.jsonl, never retried, and the run
  ships fewer examples. The gate REDRAFTS scenario-level failures from
  scratch; the refine REWRITES surface problems in place — complementary,
  composed in that order.

The Part 4 checklist re-prints at the end as verification; thresholds are the
spec's, enforcement stays human.

Handwritten examples can be imported ahead of drafting via
config dad.dilemmas.seed_path (JSONL with prompt/user_message, optional
annotation and id); seeds carry no scenario. Generated IDs continue the
AW-#### series above the highest existing ID, per the spec.
